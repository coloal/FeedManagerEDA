NOTES:
** Please be patient while the chart is being deployed **
Redis(TM) can be accessed via port 6379 on the following DNS names from within your cluster:

composed-release-redis-master.redis.svc.cluster.local for read/write operations
composed-release-redis-slave.redis.svc.cluster.local for read-only operations


To get your password run:

    export COMPOSED_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace redis composed-release-redis -o jsonpath="{.data.redis-password}" | base64 --decode)

To connect to your Redis(TM) server:

1. Run a Redis(TM) pod that you can use as a client:
   kubectl run --namespace redis composed-release-redis-client --rm --tty -i --restart='Never' \
    --env COMPOSED_PASSWORD=$COMPOSED_PASSWORD \
   --image docker.io/coloal/custom_redis:0.99 -- bash

2. Connect using the Redis(TM) CLI:
   redis-cli -h composed-release-redis-master -a $COMPOSED_PASSWORD
   redis-cli -h composed-release-redis-slave -a $COMPOSED_PASSWORD

To connect to your database from outside the cluster execute the following commands:

    kubectl port-forward --namespace redis svc/composed-release-redis-master 6379:6379 &
    redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 -a $COMPOSED_PASSWORD
